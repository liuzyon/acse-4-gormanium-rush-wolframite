## About Gormanium-Rush

Gormanium-Rush can determine the optimum circuit configuration and performance for a valuable-material-recycling circuit that contains several separation units. Each unit and the overall circuit produce two products: a concentrate stream and a tailings stream. Parameters that affect the optimum circuit configuration include the number of units, the price paid for gormanium relative to the cost of disposing of the waste material, and the purity of the input feed. The optimum circuit will be an economic decision based on the balance between how much should be paid for the product and penalised for a lack of purity. Therefore, it's a compromise between the overall recovery (total mass of valuable material recovered) and purity (proportion of valuable material to the total material recovered).

The optimization algorithm used to find the solution is the genetic algorithm. It works in a manner similar to natural selection. The heart of the algorithm is a representation of the problem as a vector of numbers (genetic code). In this problem, the genetic code represents the connections in the circuit:

The performance of the circuit is evaluated by the adaptability function, and the circuit with better performance is selected by the selection function. In this problem, we use Linear ranking selection.

After getting the solution, the post-processing module can convert any circuit vector into an image of the circuit that this vector represents. The `Graphviz` library was used in this module.


## Installation

To install Gormanium-Rush, run the following commands:

```
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/acse-2020/acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite.git
cd acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite

# install pre-requisites with makefile
make
```

The visualisation python module requires a working python installation of `Graphviz`. For conda users a working environment can be

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate acse-4-p3
```

or you can (conda) install the packages yourself
```
conda install graphviz python-graphviz
```


## Usage

This section will introduce on how to use Gormanium-Rush and give a few simple examples.

### Simulator

Run the main simulator with this command:

```
# run main simulator
g++ src/main.cpp
```

Firstly, the parameters used would be printed in console:

```
Starting The Gormanium Rush...
Gormanium feed rate: 10kg/s
Waste feed rate: 100kg/s
Purity of feed stream: 9.09091%
Gormanium price: 100£/kg
Waste cost: 500£/kg
The number of units in a circuit: 10
```

Then the simulating process would start. When finished, the information of the optimised circuit configuration would be printed.

```
The best vector is:
9 4 8 10 4 7 11 1 7 1 3 3 2 4 5 1 9 4 6 4 0
At generation: 630
The best performace is: 165.76
```

After this an [`info.txt`](https://github.com/acse-2020/acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite/blob/main/output/info.txt) would be generated in the output folder, which is the dependent file of visualisation.


### Visualisation

Visualisation relies on the file containing the circuit configuration information, including the circuit vector, number of iterations, and performance score.
After reading in this file, the number of units will be automatically calculated and the connection diagram will be drawn.
In general, circuit simulation will automatically generate a document containing the best circuit configuration information.

The provided [`info.txt`](https://github.com/acse-2020/acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite/blob/main/output/info.txt) contains these informations of optimised circuit we got in the simulator.

To visualise the output circuit, run the following command:

```
python post_processing.py
```

Then the circuit connection graph will be generated in the output folder:

You can directly modify the [`info.txt`](https://github.com/acse-2020/acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite/blob/main/output/info.txt), enter your own vector and draw the circuit connection diagram.
