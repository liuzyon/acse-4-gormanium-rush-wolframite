## About Gormanium-Rush

Gormanium-Rush can determine the optimum circuit configuration and performance for valuable-material-recycling circuit that contains several separation units. Each unit and overall circuit produce two products: a concentrate stream and a tailings stream. Parameters that affect the optimum circuit including the number of units, the price paid for gormanium relative to the cost of disposing of the waste material, and the purity of the input feed. The optimum circuit will be an economic decision based on the balance between how much should be paid for the product and penalised for a lack purity. Therefore, it's a compromise between the overall recovery (total mass of valuable material recovered) and purity (proportion of valuable material to the total material recovered).

The optimization algorithm used to find the solution is the genetic algorithm. It works in a manner similar to natural selection. The heart of the algorithm is a representation of the problem as a vector of numbers (genetic code). In this problem, the genetic code represents the connections in the circuit:

The performance of the circuit is evaluated by the adaptability function, and the circuit with better performance is selected by the selection function. In this problem, we use Linear ranking selection.

Post-processing moudule can convert any circuit vector into an image of the circuit that this vector represents. Graphviz library was used in this module.


## Installation

To install Gormanium-Rush, run the following commands:

```
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/acse-2020/acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite.git
cd acse-4-gormanium-rush-wolframite

# install pre-requisites
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The visualization python module requires a working python installation of Graphviz. For conda users a working environment can be 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate acse-4-p3
```

or you can (conda) install the packages yourself
```
conda install graphviz python-graphviz
```


## Usage

To use Gormanium-Rush, first run the main simulator with this command:

```
# run main simulator
gcc src/main.cpp
```

This will generate info.txt in output folder, which is the dependent file of visualization.

To visualise the output circuit, run the following command:

```
python post_processing.py
```

Then the circuit connection graph will be generated in output folder.
